## Machine Learning to support Clinical Decision Making in Patients with Acute Abdominal Pain

### Problem
- Patients with acute abdominal pain have to be assessed several times a day

- The assessment must also be performed under difficult conditions (e.g., at night, under time pressure, in parallel)
